Question 1:

Cell c = new BloodCell(); is valid.

Cell c = new RedBloodCell; is also valid.

BloodCell = c new RedBloodCell(). This is invalid, the first call into new RedBlooCell should be to super
which in this case would be cell.

RedBloodcell c = new Bloodcell() This is invalid as RedBloodcell extends Bloodcell and would not have
the correct methods.


Question 2:

1. Makes sense, oven is in a kitchen.
2. Makes sense, guitar is an instrument.
3. Makes sense I guess... but a person is more than their job :)
4. If your super class is only engines, then I suppose ferrari would make sense.
   If your super class is something like cars than no.
5. Makes sense, fried egg is a food.
6. Does not make sense. Dog should extend pet and then beagle can extend that, it could work though, but poor form.
7. does not make sense, jar is a type of container.
8. does not make sense, martini is a type of bevearge.
9. does not make sense, titanium is a type of metal.
10. Makes sense the rolling stones are a rock band.


Question 3:

public abstract class Pet
{
    String petName;
    int petYear;

    public class Pet ( String name, int year )
    {
        this.petName = name;
        this petYear = year;
    }
}
